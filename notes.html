    <h1>My Album Reccomendation's!</h1>
<h2>
  Album: Night At The Opera: This Album is one of my favorites from the best band, Queen! ‘A Night at The Opera’, named after the Marx Bros film, is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest albums of all time. Exceptional on every level, musically, lyrically and artistically, Queen took the strongest elements of their previous two albums to make the ultimate winning combination. This album features one of Queen's best known songs, "Bohemian Rhapsody"
  
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Album: Folklore: This beautiful album is by none other then my queen Taylor Swift. This was the album that really got me interested in her whole discography. The writing and storytelling in this album is one of a kind and it forces people to listen to the words so they can understand whats happening.
    </h3>
    <h4>
      Album: Unreal Unearth: This album is by my king Hozier. All his music is some of my favorite folksy/alternative songs but its really hard to place his music in a gentre. The songs in this album is heavily lyric based but it also rund smoothly to any listener. If you give this album a try, I recommend "Unkown/nth" and "Francessca".
    </h4>
    <h5>
      Album: Atlas:Enneagram: This Album is by the band Sleeping At Last. This album has songs that are all different numbers, but every song is very to specfic to a person. The song that you might connect with the most should be your enneagram number. The song that I connect with the most is "Five". I think the concept of this album is very beautiful, and I think it should get more love from the public.
